      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;is-this-marmot-audio&#34;&gt;Is this Marmot Audio?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good question! In spirit: yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before closing down my old website I posted this which explains things a little more:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time has come to close the shutters on Marmot Audio. I&amp;rsquo;ve been neglecting it for some time now. Apologies to any potential customers who might have emailed me in the last few months and received no reply: that was uncharacteristically rude of me and I hope you found help elsewhere with your projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="is-this-marmot-audio">Is this Marmot Audio?</h1>
<p>Good question! In spirit: yes.</p>
<p>Just before closing down my old website I posted this which explains things a little more:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The time has come to close the shutters on Marmot Audio. I&rsquo;ve been neglecting it for some time now. Apologies to any potential customers who might have emailed me in the last few months and received no reply: that was uncharacteristically rude of me and I hope you found help elsewhere with your projects.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no drama. I took a full-time job at a brewery last year and since then I&rsquo;m running the place. As such it&rsquo;s demanding much more of my time and more of my physical and mental energy. Something had to give.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to express gratitude and humility to everyone who trusted (and often confounded) me with their projects. I got to work on some amazing audio gear and made many friends along the way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure some of you have stumbled across my recent adventures in Max and OSC. I&rsquo;m still pretty active in those areas (handy to be able to do your projects on a laptop!). I&rsquo;m going to consolidate (and archive) a bunch of stuff and you&rsquo;ll be able to find it all on a new website which is hosted on my Github repository.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which brings us right here!</p>
<h3 id="so-what-is-use-hearing-protection-then">So what is USE HEARING PROTECTION then?</h3>
<p>Truthfully it&rsquo;s my attempt to try to consolidate all the little bits of me, current and archived projects, into one place on the internet. If that sounds awfully vain, believe me that it&rsquo;s selfishness masquerading as altruism.</p>
<h3 id="no-i-mean-why-use-hearing-protection">No, I mean <em>why</em> USE HEARING PROTECTION?</h3>
<p>Well, from a safety and the long-term health of your hearing point-of-view, it&rsquo;s just some good advice.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a much longer story about growing up in Manchester in the 80s and how that is a deep part of my creative psyche. The short answer is it&rsquo;s inspired by Peter Saville&rsquo;s iconic FAC 1 gig posters from his when he was the designer for Factory Records. Here&rsquo;s the design used on the 2019 box-set &ldquo;Use Hearing Protection: Factory Records 1978-79&rdquo;:</p>

<p>Expect sporadic updates and long periods of neglect. Like most of my other projects. I make no apologies.</p>
